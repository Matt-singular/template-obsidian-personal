## Introduction
Welcome to the Obsidian documentation template.  Below each of the main sections have been listed (including links to the section-specific READMEs).

Have a look through each of the sections (there are some placeholder files that require some changes to the content).

You are encouraged to revise and change the structure to fit your project needs (for starters you should replace this welcome message with a project specific one)

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application designed to help you capture, organise, and connect your thoughts and ideas.

Obsidian uses a plaintext markdown format and will create complex networks and graphs based on links found within the notes.

Some simple community plugins have been enabled here to enhance templating, diagrams and more.

Download Obsidian from their [official website](https://obsidian.md).
