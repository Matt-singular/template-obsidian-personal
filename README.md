Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application designed to help you capture, organise, and connect your thoughts and ideas.

Obsidian uses a plaintext markdown format and will create complex networks and graphs based on links found within the notes.

Some simple community plugins have been enabled here to enhance templating, diagrams and more.
